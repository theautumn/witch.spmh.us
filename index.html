<h1>Sarah Autumn </h1>

<h3><u>Museum</u></h3>
<p>
I'm a switch witch at the Connections Museum, in Seattle. I keep the machines running,
so that visitors can come and enjoy them. I am particularly proud of this. Most of the
older folks have either passed away, or can't come in as much anymore, so someone must
take up the task. I am glad to do it!

<h3><u>Music</u></h3>
<p>
Music is one of my primary forms of emotional expression. I have been playing for most of
my life, however I tend to avoid memorization and theory, and instead play primarily with
intuition. I find that some musicians like this, and some don't. Instruments I am reasonably 
fluent with guitar, bass, drums, sitar, and my voice. I have been writing, but
have not released anything in a while. My music can mostly be found
<a href="https://theautumn.bandcamp.com"> here</a>.

<h3><u>Other Stuff</u></h3>
<p>
Finally, I'm a burner (yes, I do the thing in the desert), and a traveler. Experiences and people are
important to me. I'd like to be known as someone who is compassionate, understanding, and joyful.
A mirror, that reflects the best parts of you back at yourself.
